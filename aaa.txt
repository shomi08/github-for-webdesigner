hi Paula,

Thanks for the invitation. I'm very interested in this job. I'm highly experienced in adobe captivate 9 to make responsive project. I also have some additional expertise like i also work as a graphic  designer, html5 animator. i'm also experienced in action script and java script. so i could be the perfect match for making an exciting course in captivate for the kids.

Wishing to wait from you soon.

Thanks
Shadik
